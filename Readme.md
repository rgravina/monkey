# Monkey

This is an interpreter for Monkey, a programming language and interpreter from the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com).

The code here I have entered as I worked through the book, but I've also made small refactorings which helped me to understand it better. For the original source, refer to the book.
